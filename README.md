# pythonvim

This is a project that has something to do with Python, and with Vim. But not Ruby, and definitely not PHP. It might include Perl, because the author uses Perl sometimes. But probably not; it will most likely be about Python. And about Vim.

And C++ on occasion, with maybe some shell scripting too.
